# About me

![picture]("assets/bild_me.jpeg")

I am a postdoctoral fellow in cosmology at the Argelander Institute for Astronomy in Bonn. Born in the beautiful town of Rostock at the baltic sea, I moved to Heidelberg for my Bachelor, Master and PhD in physics. After finishing my doctoral studies, I stayed for two years at the Technion, the Israel Institute for Technology as a Postdoc.
