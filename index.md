# About me

![picture]("assets/bild_me.jpeg")

I am a postdoctoral fellow in cosmology at the Argelander Institute for Astronomy in Bonn. Born in the beautiful town of Rostock on the Baltic Sea, I moved to Heidelberg to pursue my Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD in physics. After completing my doctoral studies, I spent two years at the Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology, as a postdoctoral researcher. Subsequently, I spent three years at the German Centre for Cosmological Lensing (GCCL) at Ruhr University Bochum and relocated to Bonn in autumn 2023.
